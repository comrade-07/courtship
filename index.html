      <h1>Hi Trisha,</h1>

      <p>
          My love for you continues to grow with each passing day. You have been a source of beauty since the first time I saw and met you. I cherish the moments when I can gaze into your beautiful eyes and witness your gorgeous smile.
      </p>
  
      <p>
          Over the past few months, as we have gotten to know each other, we've shared laughter and faced hardships together. In every moment we've experienced, we've both shed tears and shared smiles. I understand that things can be challenging at times, but I don't want us to give up. I love you, and I believe you are worth the effort. With your permission, may I court you and win your heart once again?
      </p>
  
      <p>
          Love,<br>
          John Mark
